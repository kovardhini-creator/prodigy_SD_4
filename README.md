## Task 4 â€“ Sudoku Solver

# Overview

This project is a web-based Sudoku solver developed as part of Task 4 for the internship program at Prodigy Infotech. The application allows users to input a Sudoku puzzle and solves it instantly using a backtracking algorithm. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers an interactive and user-friendly interface for puzzle input and solution display.

# Features

~ Interactive 9x9 Sudoku grid for easy puzzle input

~ Real-time validation and solving using a recursive backtracking algorithm

~ Clear and intuitive UI with responsive input fields

~ Instant feedback upon solving or if no solution exists

~ No external dependencies, runs fully in the browser

# Usage

Requirements
~ Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.)

# How to Use

~ Open the index.html file in your web browser

~ Enter the Sudoku puzzle numbers in the grid (empty cells left blank)

~ Click the Solve button to compute the solution

~ The solved puzzle will be displayed in the grid; if unsolvable, an alert will notify you

# Technical Details

~ The solver uses a classic backtracking algorithm to fill empty cells one by one, ensuring each number placement is valid according to Sudoku rules.

~ Validation checks rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids to maintain puzzle constraints.

~ The UI is built using a dynamically generated HTML table with input fields for user interaction.

~ The application offers clear alerts to inform users about the result of the solving process.
