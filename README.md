💡 Task 4 – Sudoku Solver

Prodigy Infotech Internship | Web Development

📘 Overview

The Sudoku Solver is a web-based tool developed as part of Task 4 in the Prodigy Infotech Internship. It enables users to enter an incomplete 9×9 Sudoku puzzle and solve it automatically using a backtracking algorithm. Built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool offers an interactive and responsive interface suitable for both beginners and logic puzzle enthusiasts.

⚙️ Features

 🧮 9x9 Dynamic Input Grid for user interaction

 🔁 Backtracking Algorithm for efficient puzzle solving

 ✅ Real-time Validation of input and logic

 🎯 Simple, intuitive, and clean UI

 💻 100% client-side – no server or database dependencies

 🔒 Safe: no external libraries or frameworks used

 🧑‍💻 How to Use
 
 ~Open the File:
 Launch task4.html in any modern web browser.

~Enter the Puzzle:
 Fill in the known values of the Sudoku puzzle. Empty cells should be left blank.

~ Solve:
Click the "Solve" button. If the puzzle is valid, the solver will display the solution instantly.

🔢 Algorithm Logic

~ The Sudoku solver uses a recursive backtracking algorithm:

~ It searches for empty cells sequentially.

~ For each cell, it tries numbers from 1 to 9.

~ It checks whether placing a number violates any Sudoku rules (row, column, 3x3 grid).

~ If a conflict arises, it backtracks and tries another number.

~ Once all cells are correctly filled, the puzzle is considered solved.

📂 File Structure
